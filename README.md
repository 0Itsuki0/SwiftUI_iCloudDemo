#  iCloud/CloudKit Demo

This repository includes the following demo.
- [Content Collaboration with CloudKit](#content-collaboration)
- [Synchronous Swift Data Automatically with ModelContainer](#sync-swift-data-automatic)


## Content Collaboration
A Simple content collaboration app where multiple users will be able collaborating on some simple notes (a title, a content).

Specifically, this demo includes the following.
- Create custom CKRecordZone for storing the records
- Create a CKRecord for the data we want to share, ie: A title and a content that the user will be editing on.
- Create a CKShare for the record when we decide to share it. Or retrieve it if already exists.
- Share our content with other users using a combination of ShareLink, SWCollaborationView, and UICloudSharingController.
- Listen to Local changes on CKShare made by user using the system UIs, for example, the share sheet. So that we can update our variables and UIs based on it.
- Accept the share.
- Listen for remote changes on the CKRecord we are editing so that we can update its content (almost) synchronously! Using CKDatabaseSubscription and CKQuerySubscription.

### Set up
In addition to the set up specified in the [Common Configuration](#common-configuration), update the `containerIdentifier` variable of the `CloudManager` to the one you will be using
```
private static let containerIdentifier: String = "iCloud.your.identifier"
```


To test it, run the app on couple real devices signed into different iCloud account.
- Notifications for subscriptions are not received correctly on simulators.

## Sync Swift Data (Automatic)
A simple app supporting Synchronizing Swift Data Model with ModelContainer.
- ModelContainer provides a fully managed schema, maintains a local replica of the data, and supports the public, private, and shared databases without any additional set up or direct interaction with CloudKit containers and databases
- We don't have control over how and when our data syncs


To set up the demo, please refer to the [Common Configuration](#common-configuration) section.

To test it, run the app on multiple simulators that are signed into the same iCloud account.
